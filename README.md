# Lets-Meet

Here we offer community with a focus. Create an account to join like minded individuals near you!

Once you have created an account you can join a group or create one. Through those groups of like minded indiviuals you can post meet-ups with a location, date and time, OR there might be some event's going on already that you might want to attend.

Keep in mind that you can only be apart of one group at a time. You are free to leave and join as much as you want. However, we feel that belonging to many groups takes away from interaction. We want you to be active with your members instead of "lurkers."
